            <p id="wikiLead">Zeus guides protection, justice, and moral order!</p>

            <h3>Guidance</h3>
            <p id="wikiAdvice">When faced with leadership or responsibility, do not shy away from making the choice. Zeus would want you to step forward with confidence, understanding that hesitation can leave a community vulnerable. Learn to listen to all sides before passing judgement, but once you have decided, stand by those decisions and see them through. Protect those who depend on you and make fairness your guiding star. Cultivate authority not through fear but through consistent actions that prove you are dependable. Avoid abusing power for personal gain because strength without honor is nothing. Keep your promises, guard reputation, and treat your word as a sacred, once broken, trust is difficult to restore. Above all, remember that your role is not to rule over others for your own sake, but to ensure that the structure you build will stand strong.</p>

            <h3>Execution</h3>
            <p id="wikiExec">To live according to Zeus's teachings, begin by developing a strong sense of responsibility in every role you hold. Practice making decisions with both speed and care, weighing facts and consequences before acting. If you lead a group or project, set clear expectations, then follow through on your commitments so others know they can depend on you. When conflicts arise take the role as a mediator, ensuring all voices are heard before choosing a path that preserves fairness and stability. Dedicate time to strengthening your presence and condfidence, speak clearly and hold yourself with dignity. Find ways to honor those around you. Over time your consistency, fairness, and abilityt to guide others will natrually place you in a position of trust and respect.</p>

            <h3>Follow-up</h3>
            <p id="wikiFollow">After taking a leadership role or making a significant decision, reflect on how you handled the responsibility. In your journal, note the challenges you faced, the choices you made, and how those choices impacted others. Ask yourself whether you acted fairly and decisively, and whether you upheld the trust placed in you. Consider what could be improved in your approach, and where you demonstrated true strength of character. Over time, thes reflections will help you see patterns in your leadership style, momenets where you stood strong under pressure and times when you might have faltered. Zeus's path is one of continual refinement, ensuring that each decision makes you a wiser, stronger, and more dependable leader than you were before.</p>
            <h3>Myth</h3> 
            <p id="wikiMyth" >Before Zeus became the ruler of the gods, the world was in the hands of the Titans, and older generation of deities. Cronus, king of the titans, feared a prophecy that one of his children would overthrow him, just as he had overthrown his own fother Uranus. To prevent this fate, Cronus swallowed each of his newbord children whole: Hestia, Demeter, Hera, Hades, and Posedion, trapping them all in his stomach. When Rhea, Cronus's wife, gave birth to her sixth child, she could not bear to lose him. She secrely gave birth to Zeus in a hidden cave on the island of Crete. She wrapped a stone in clothes and handed it to Cronus who swallowed it without suspicion. Meanwhile, baby Zeus whom was nursed by the goat Amalthea and guarded by the Curetes who clashed their shields to hide his cries. As Zeus grew he became stronger and more clever. When the time was right he returned in disguise to confront Cronus and with the help of the Titaness Metis, he tricked Cronus into drinking a potion that forced him to throw up Zeus's siblings who were now fully grown gods. Together they delcared war against the titans called the Titanomachy. For 10 years the Olympians battked the Titans aided by the Cyclopes Zeus forged with thunderbolts. In the end the Olympians won and casted the Titans deep into Tartarus. Zeus then divided the world with his brothers. Poseidon took the sea and Hades claimed the underworld. Though Zeus was the supreme ruler he was also known for his many love affairs, both with goddesses and mortals. From these unions came: Athena, Apollo and Aretemis, Hermes, Persephone, Perseus, Heracles, and many MANY others. These relationships often stirred conflicts with his wife Hera. Despite his flaws Zeus was revered as the upholder of justice and the protector of guests and travlers. He watched over oaths and punished those who broke them and was invoked as the guardian of order in both the divine and mortal worlds. In myth after myth, Zeus appears as the decisive force, the god who intervenes when balance must be restored, whether through wisdom, wrath, or raw power. </p>
