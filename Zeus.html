            <p id="wikiLead">Aphrodite guides love, beauty, and the courage to be vulnerable. She is also a god of war!</p>

            <h3>Guidance</h3>
            <p id="wikiAdvice">Start by taking one small social step at a time that may look like giving a genuine compliment, joining a new group, or simply smiling at somone. These small actions open doors to deeper connections and let you practice both kindness and vulnerability, which Aphrodite controls. Don't rush let your condfidence grow natrually as you begin to embrace the joy of relating to others. At the same time make sure you are paying close attention to how you nurture yourself: Surround yourself with things and people that make you feel beautiful and joyful, that may be your favorite color or music that lifts your mood. Remember that pleasure and self care aren't indulgences but vital parts of living fully. Allow yourself those moments of creative expression, or quiet reflection. Little by little thes practices will help you weave love, beauty, and connection into your everyday life.</p>

            <h3>Execution</h3>
            <p id="wikiExec">In order to embody Aphrodite's teaching you must look inward. Recognizing that inner beauty and self worth are the foundation that all other love is built on. This means caring for your body and spirit with kindness, embracing your uniqness, and surrounding yourself with things and people that bring you joy. Aphrodite encourages celebrations of all categeories of love not only romance, but also deep friendships, familial bonds, and compassion for others. Opening your heart, practicing vulnerability, and genuine connections are essential. At the same time Aphrodite teaches to embrace pleasure as sacred forces and allows us to engage our senses fully and find joy in the everyday moments. We are urged to bring new ideas and nurture growth around us as well as trusting the cycle of renewal thats shaping our lives. Aphrodite calls for harmony and balance while also blending passion with wisdom and striving for peace even in conflicts. Beyond personal practices Aphrodite inspires us to create and appreciate the beauty of the world and create beauty through kindness, thoughful surroundings, and artistic pursuits that uplift ourselves and others. However, she also warns us about the power of desire which bring joy, but chaos is not far behind, she urges mindfulness, respect for boundaries, and reflection about the deeper motives behind our wants.</p>

            <h3>Follow-up</h3>
            <p id="wikiFollow">After taking the time to take those small steps make it a habit to journal about how each interaction made you feel. Notice what emotions came up: where you nervous? Scared? Uncomfortable? Reflect on what was unexpected or new about the experience and whether it was how someoner responded or how you reacted. This reflection helps you deepen your awareness which are key parts of Aphrodite's teachings. Over time journaling can reveal pattersn you may have never seen before like new joys or challenges, which in turn help you grow more condfident and authentic.</p>

            <h3>Myth</h3> 
            <p id="wikiMyth" >Before Zeus became the ruler of the gods, the world was in the hands of the Titans, and older generation of deities. Cronus, king of the titans, feared a prophecy that one of his children would overthrow him, just as he had overthrown his own fother Uranus. To prevent this fate, Cronus swallowed each of his newbord children whole: Hestia, Demeter, Hera, Hades, and Posedion, trapping them all in his stomach. When Rhea, Cronus's wife, gave birth to her sixth child, she could not bear to lose him. She secrely gave birth to Zeus in a hidden cave on the island of Crete. She wrapped a stone in clothes and handed it to Cronus who swallowed it without suspicion. Meanwhile, baby Zeus whom was nursed by the goat Amalthea and guarded by the Curetes who clashed their shields to hide his cries. As Zeus grew he became stronger and more clever. When the time was right he returned in disguise to confront Cronus and with the help of the Titaness Metis, he tricked Cronus into drinking a potion that forced him to throw up Zeus's siblings who were now fully grown gods. Together they delcared war against the titans called the Titanomachy. For 10 years the Olympians battked the Titans aided by the Cyclopes Zeus forged with thunderbolts. In the end the Olympians won and casted the Titans deep into Tartarus. Zeus then divided the world with his brothers. Poseidon took the sea and Hades claimed the underworld. Though Zeus was the supreme ruler he was also known for his many love affairs, both with goddesses and mortals. From these unions came: Athena, Apollo and Aretemis, Hermes, Persephone, Perseus, Heracles, and many MANY others. These relationships often stirred conflicts with his wife Hera. Despite his flaws Zeus was revered as the upholder of justice and the protector of guests and travlers. He watched over oaths and punished those who broke them and was invoked as the guardian of order in both the divine and mortal worlds. In myth after myth, Zeus appears as the decisive force, the god who intervenes when balance must be restored, whether through wisdom, wrath, or raw power. </p>
