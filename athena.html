            <p id="wikiLead">Athena guides wisdom, strategy, and civilized warefare.</p>

            <h3>Guidance</h3>
            <p id="wikiAdvice">When confronted with a problem or decision resist the urge to act immediately. Athena would rather you pause, observe, and analyze before taking another step. Break up the situation into managable pieces, so taht each can be understood in isolation before you see how they connect all together. Consider every possible outcome, weighing not only how they affect you, but also others. She does not want you to avoid action, but to ensure that you act with purpose and percision. Build habits that strengthen the mind: read, practice skills, and learn to adapt. Remember that justice should guide your actions just as much as reason. Treat others with fairness even in disagreement because lasting victories are those that end with respect. Athena's advice is as much about character as it is success: if you can act both with clarity and honor, you are truly walking her path.</p>
            <h3>Execution</h3>
            <p id="wikiExec">To live by Athena's teachings is to approach each day as both a student and a strategist. Begin bt developing a daily practice of learning, whether thats studying a new subject, improving a skill, or observing the world around you with a critical eye. Use challenges as oppertunities to apply what you've learned, testing different methods to see which are most effective. When faced with a decision create a clear plan before acting, write down your goal, list your options, and identify possible risks and benefits for each. Then chooose the course that aligns with both your desired outcome and fairness and long-term stability. Incorporate rituals that strengthen patience and focus, such as quiet reflection before a major tasks. In moments of conflict, draw on both empathy and reason, seeking solutions that resolve tension without unnecessary har. Over time you will find that  this blend of preperation, adaptability, and moral clarity doesn't just help you win battles, it transforms you into someone other trust to lead, solve problmes, and create harmony in the midst of chaos.</p>

            <h3>Follow-up</h3>
            <p id="wikiFollow">After you have faced the challenge using Athena's strategic approach, set aside time to look back and study the experience. The reflection is as important as the action itself. In your journal, record what strategies you used, why you chose them, and what results they produced. Pay attention to moments where patience or foresight helped you avoid mistakes, as well as instances where you might have overlooked an important detail. Ask yourself how you might improve your process next time, and whether your decisions upheld both wisdom and fairness. These entries will form a personal map of growth allowing you to trace how your thihnking has evolved. Athena's path is not a quick transformation, but a lifelong sharpening of the mind and spirit.</p>

            <h3>Myth</h3> 
            <p id="wikiMyth" >Lady Athena or Αθηνά in greek is the Greek goddess of wisdom, strategy, and civilized warfare. She also oversees crafts, justice, and the protection of cities. She is often portrayed as the calm strategist in contrast to the bloodlust of Ares. In the myths, Athena is unique among the Olympian. She was born fully grown and armoured from the forehead of Zeus after he swallowed her pregnant mother, Metis, the goddess of cunning though. This birth made her embody both intellect and warcraft. She was a virgin goddess, dedicated to her independaence, and was often called Pallas Athena. Beyond the battle field she inspired inventors, artists, and guided civilation toward order and fairness. She invented the flute, gave the olive tree to Athens, and served as a protector of heroes like Odysseus, Perseus, and Heracles. Athena's wisdom was not intellectual but practicle. She valued foresight, clever problem-solving, and patience in execution. In war, she favored those who used strategy and disciple compared to brute force. She was an ally to those she deemed worthy and stern to those she didn't. Her sacred city thrived under her patronage and they honored her through festivals like the Panathenaia.</p>
