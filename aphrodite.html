            <h3>Execution</h3>
            <p id="wikiExec">In order to embody Aphrodite's teaching you must look inward. Recognizing that inner beauty and self worth are the foundation that all other love is built on.

Aphrodite encourages celebrations of all categeories of love not only romance, but also deep friendships, familial bonds, and compassion for others. Opening your heart, practicing vulnerability, and genuine connections are essential. At the same time Aphrodite teaches to embrace pleasure as sacred forces and allows us to engage our senses fully and find joy in the everyday moments. We are urged to bring new ideas and nurture growth around us as well as trusting the cycle of renewal thats shaping our lives. Aphrodite calls for harmony and balance while also blending passion with wisdom and striving for peace even in conflicts. Beyond personal practices Aphrodite inspires us to create and appreciate the beauty of the world and create beauty through kindness, thoughful surroundings, and artistic pursuits that uplift ourselves and others. However, she also warns us about the power of desire which bring joy, but chaos is not far behind, she urges mindfulness, respect for boundaries, and reflection about the deeper motives behind our wants.</p>

            <h3>Follow-up</h3>
            <p id="wikiFollow">After taking the time to take those small steps make it a habit to journal about how each interaction made you feel. Notice what emotions came up: where you nervous? Scared? Uncomfortable? Reflect on what was unexpected or new about the experience and whether it was how someoner responded or how you reacted. This reflection helps you deepen your awareness which are key parts of Aphrodite's teachings. Over time journaling can reveal pattersn you may have never seen before like new joys or challenges, which in turn help you grow more condfident and authentic.</p>

            <h3>Myth</h3> 
            <p id="wikiMyth" >Lady Aphrodite has two version in which her myth is told. In Hesiod's Theogony she emerges from sea foam near the island of Cyprus. Aphrodite arises fully grown and breathtakingly beautiful. Due to this she is often called "foam-born" or ἀφρός in greek. In Homer's iliad Aphrodite is described as the daughter of Zeus and Dione. Homer emphasizes her role within the Olympian family rather than her birth. People normally percive her the way Homer writes. Aphrodite's marriage was arranged by Zeus, and she was to wed Hephaestus, the god of fire and metalwork. Hephaestus was an obvious contrast to Aphrodite, he was imperfect and lame. It was obvious that their marriage was one of politcal status and not deep love. Aphrodite had many lovers including gods and mortals. Her most notable is her affair with Ares the god of war and protector of women. They had several children together including but not limited to, Eros or better known as Cupid, god of love, and Harmonia, goddess of harmony. Aphrodite also bedded Anchises a trojan prince in which Aeneas was born. One of the most famous myths that involve Aphrodite is the Judgement of Paris. Eris, the goddess of discord threw and apple that was dedicated 'to the fairest' into the wedding feast of the gods. Hera, Athena, and Aphrodite claimed it was for them. Paris, a trojan prince was chosen to be the judge of who the apple truly belonged to. Each goddess offerd a bribe: Hera offered power, Athen offered wisdom and skill in battle, and Aphrodite offered the love of the most beautiful women in the world, Helen of Sparta. In the end Paris gave the apple to Aphrodite, however Helen of Sparta had already been married to King Menelaus of Sparta. Aphrodite protected the trojans during the war and intervened several times to keep them out of harms way. </p>
