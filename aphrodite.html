            <h3>Myth</h3> 
            <p id="wikiMyth" >Lady Aphrodite has two version in which her myth is told. In Hesiod's Theogony she emerges from sea foam near the island of Cyprus. Aphrodite arises fully grown and breathtakingly beautiful. Due to this she is often called "foam-born" or ἀφρός in greek. In Homer's iliad Aphrodite is described as the daughter of Zeus and Dione. Homer emphasizes her role within the Olympian family rather than her birth. People normally perciver her the way Homer writes. Aphrodite's marriage was arranged by Zeus, and she was to wed Hephaestus, the god of fire and metalwork. Hephaestus was an obvious contrast to Aphrodite, he was imperfect and lame. It was obvious that their marriage was one of politcal status and not deep love. Aphrodite had many lovers including gods and mortals. Her most notable is her affair with Ares the god of war and protector of women. They had several children together including but not limited to, Eros or better known as Cupid, god of love, and Harmonia, goddess of harmony. Aphrodite also bedded Anchises a trojan prince in which Aeneas was born. One of the most famous myths that involve Aphrodite is the Judgement of Paris. Eris, the goddess of discord threw and apple that was dedicated 'to the fairest' into the wedding feast of the gods. Hera, Athena, and Aphrodite claimed it was for them. Paris, a trojan prince was chosen to be the judge of who the apple truly belonged to. Each goddess offerd a bribe: Hera offered power, Athen offered wisdom and skill in battle, and Aphrodite offered the love of the most beautiful women in the world, Helen of Sparta. In the end Paris gave the apple to Aphrodite, however Helen of Sparta had already been married to King Menelaus of Sparta. Aphrodite protected the trojans during the war and intervened several times to keep them out of harms way. </p>
